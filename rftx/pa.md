# Power Amplifier — What to Learn First (Top-Level Outline)

1. **PA Classes & Operating Modes**
   - Class AB, Doherty, Envelope Tracking basics.

2. **Key PA Performance Metrics**
   - Gain  
   - PAE (power-added efficiency)  
   - Linearity (IMD, ACLR)  
   - Output power levels (P1dB, Psat)

3. **Linearity Problems & Why DPD Exists**
   - PA distortion  
   - Memory effects  
   - Why OFDM makes PA suffer

4. **PA Architecture Used in Sub-6 5G**
   - Doherty PA (main + auxiliary path)  
   - High efficiency at back-off

5. **Matching Networks (Input/Output)**
   - Impedance matching  
   - Bandwidth considerations

6. **Thermal Design & Biasing**
   - Bias circuits  
   - Heat handling

7. **Integration Aspects**
   - Interfaces with driver amp, filters, duplexer
